# Privacy Policy — Bringetto Inbox Blaster

**Last updated:** February 24, 2026

## Overview

Bringetto Inbox Blaster is a Chrome extension that helps you bulk archive Gmail messages. Your privacy is fundamental to how this extension is built — it was designed from the ground up to never collect, store, or transmit any of your data.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect any data.** Specifically:

- No personal information is collected
- No email content is read, stored, or transmitted
- No browsing history is tracked
- No analytics or telemetry data is gathered
- No cookies are set by the extension
- No accounts or logins are required

## How the Extension Works

Bringetto Inbox Blaster operates entirely within your browser. When you use the extension:

1. It interacts with the Gmail web interface in your active browser tab
2. It selects and archives messages based on your chosen criteria (unstarred or older than a specified number of days)
3. All processing happens locally in your browser — no data is sent to any external server

## Permissions

The extension requests the following Chrome permissions:

- **activeTab** — To interact with the Gmail tab you have open when you click the extension icon
- **scripting** — To execute the archiving script within your Gmail tab
- **host_permissions (mail.google.com)** — To operate on Gmail pages only

These permissions are the minimum required for the extension to function. No broader access is requested or used.

## Third-Party Services

Bringetto Inbox Blaster does **not** use any third-party services, APIs, or servers. There are no external network requests made by the extension.

## Data Storage

The extension does not store any data locally or remotely. It does not use Chrome's storage APIs, localStorage, or any other persistence mechanism. Each time you use the extension, it starts fresh with no saved state.

## Children's Privacy

The extension does not collect any data from any user, including children under the age of 13.

## Changes to This Policy

If this privacy policy is updated, the changes will be reflected on this page with an updated date. Since the extension collects no data, meaningful changes to this policy are unlikely.
